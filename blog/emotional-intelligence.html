        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Defined by John D. Mayer, professor of psychology at University of New Hampshire as “
          he ability to accurately perceive your own and others’ emotions; to understand the signals that emotions send about relationships; and to manage your own and others’ emotions”. - This concept is also known as Emotional Quotient (or EQ). I will be using these two terms interchangeably in this blog post.
          Emotional intelligence allows us to be aware of and identify our emotions and how they impact out reactions to everyday situations. It can also increase our capacity for empathy - the ability to put yourself in another person’s shoes and see a situation from their point of view.</p>
          <p>It consists of personal competence and social competence with two skills each:
            <ul>
              <li>Personal competence - your ability to stay aware of your emotions and manage your behaviour and tendencies. Consists of:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Self-awareness - ability to accurately perceive your emotions and stay aware of them as they happen</li>
                <li>Self-management - ability to use said awareness to stay flexible and positively direct your behaviour</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li> Social Competence - involves understanding other people’s moods, behaviour, and motives in order to respond effectively and improve the quality of your relationships. Consists of:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Social awareness - how accurately you can pick up on emotions in other people and understand what is really going on</li>
                <li>Relationship management - ability to use awareness of your emotions and the emotions of others to manage interactions successfully</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>How is it different ot IQ?</h3>
          <p>There is no connection between IQ and EQ - you can’t predict EQ based on how smart someone is. Some studies and surveys indicate that EQ is a greater predecessor of success than IQ. Intelligence is your ability to learn and is relatively fixed over your life, whereas emotional intelligence is a flexible set of skills that can be acquired and improved with practice. Also, unlike IQ, EQ can’t necessarily be captured via psychometric tests, as it lacks true explanatory power. Our brains are malleable and able to be changed - so increasing your EQ is something that can be achieved through repetitive practice. Our brains process emotions before our rational mind has the time to engage, but through practicing emotionally intelligent behaviours will help you to respond to your surroundings in a more mindful way without even realising it.</p>
          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <p>EQ helps us be aware of and control our own emotions, to understand them, and to manage and use them to attend to any given situation in an appropriate way. In a similar way that mindfulness brings us into and aware of ourselves and our own emotions, emotional intelligence is mindfulness and awareness of others emotions. The impacts of emotional intelligence in relationships with others and with ourselves are an increased capacity to be personally and socially competent and to have deeper and more meaningful relationships and understanding of ourselves and others. Not only is it super beneficial in personal relationships, but the benefits carry over into the professional sphere as well. One study that tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other skills found that EQ is the strongest predictor of performance, explaining 58% of success in all types of jobs.</p>

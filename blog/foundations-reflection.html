        <h3>Three new things I've learnt about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I’ve learnt that I really don’t like failure, no matter how small. I am afraid of doing something wrong and so sometimes I am afraid to try.</li>
                <li>I can handle more than I think I can. And am capable of more than I think I can. It’s just about pushing past the barriers into the uncomfortable zone where I can really thrive.</li>
                <li>Mindfulness practices (i.e. journalling, breathing techniques) are really helpful for me and allow me to stay in a good mindset when doing work and coming across challenges and it’s sure noticeable when I haven’t focussed on that stuff on a particular day.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>Values are the foundation of all in learning and working with others. How we work with ourselves and with others are massive factors in how successful one will be with learning and in programming. No one person knows everything and giving and receiving help and feedback are critical to success, Being empathetic in approaches to others is huge because no one will listen to you or appreciate your input if you’re unable to respond with empathy or come at it with an angle of understanding and softness. This leads into self awareness and being aware of your strength and limitations and playing to those and really understanding who you are in order to thrive.</p>
        <h3>What has surprised you most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>Just how much of it really isn’t tough in NZ schools. It all seems so straightforward	and basic common sense but I think a lot of people (especially kiwis) aren’t taught this sort of stuff and we go around masking our feelings and being tall poppies and in general aren’t super in tough with our emotional sides.</p>
        <h3>Most challenging aspects of core learning?</h3>
            <p>My most challenging aspect was doing the listening and looping exercises. I know that I am good at listening and looping when it doesn’t involve something I’ve done, but I not so great the nit does as I move into defensive mode. Trying to remove myself from the situation always and look at the other person’s experience from their angle is really tough for me and something I am working on and looking forward to continuing to work on. And knowing it’s not a competition and is a skill that can be practiced and honed in on is helpful to remind myself.</p>
        <h3>Why do you think EDA is spending so much time focussing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>Because the ‘core’ concepts really are what’s missing, not just in the tech sector, but I feel like across all industries. I think in this capitalist society so much emphasis is put on being the best most productive worker, often at the detriment of other aspects of our lives. More recently the needle has shifted and more focus is being put on having a better balance in life and the values, empathy and other core learnings are a massive part of that shift.</p>
        <h3>Does the time you spend studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer</h3>
            <p>No way. As previously mentioned - I think there’s no point in learning programming if you don’t know how to communicate effectively within yourself and with others in your team.</p>

      <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <h4>What is neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p>
        It was long thought that the brain was hard-wired and unable to change,
        however it has since been discovered that we can create new pathways and
        connections between neurons in the brain. Over time these connections
        become thicker with more neurons and old pathways that aren’t used get
        pruned and trimmed off.
      </p>
      <h4>
        How does understanding the concepts of neuroplasticity benefit learning?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Interestingly if you understand the principles of neuroplasticity you
        are more likely to succeed. One study showed that children who
        understood the brain was plastic and their intelligence wasn’t
        predetermined were more likely to get better grades and have better
        morale. Knowing that one is fully capable of learning new things and
        changing ones brain makes motivation to do things easier to come by as
        just practising and trying (regardless of if something is a ‘success’ or
        ‘fail’) is enough to be able to change the brain to learn new things.
      </p>
      <h4>How could you engage with these principles for your own benefit?</h4>
      <p>
        Repetition, use it or lose it, and use it and improve it are all super
        relevant in learning programming as the more you to things the more
        ‘muscle memory’ you have and the more your brain makes and solidifies
        those learning pathways.
      </p>
      <h4>Ways to improve your neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>
        There are a handful of vitamins that help to support neuroplasticity.
        These are: magnesium, selenium and omega-3. Regular, good sleep and
        exercise (both low and high intensity exercise will boost the production
        of BDNF (a particular chemical that assists with the firing or
        neurons)). Learning a new language, making art, playing an instrument,
        and travelling are also things that can increase neuroplasticity.
        Reducing stress and increasing meditation can also boost neuroplasticity

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h4>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is when an individual believes their talents can be
        developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others.
        They tend to achieve more than these with a more fixed mindset. This
        relates closely to neuroplasticity. Understanding that our brains are
        plastic and can be changed for the better is a growth mindset. Everyone
        is a mixture between fixed and growth mindsets. Some things are harder
        to be growth oriented about for many reasons. Receiving criticism,
        insecurity, defensiveness among other triggers, can cause a response
        that inhibits growth.
      </p>
      <h4>What surprised me in this exploration of growth mindset?</h4>
      <p>
        Dr Dweck’s work on growth mindset and in particular the key phrase of
        “not, yet” and how calling students “not, yet” instead of pass/fail like
        traditional education systems. And how this had a big impact on students
        learning and success (whatever that may be).
      </p>
      <h4>How will I intergrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h4>
      <p>
        I really am trying to incorporate the “not yet” mindset into my everyday
        life. As a former ‘gifted student’ I have struggled a lot in my
        education journey with not being good enough, or smart enough as the
        other kids started to catch up to and pass my perceived intelligence.
        Knowing that brains are malleable and that you can literally learn and
        be good at anything (minus maybe some genetic factors in sports) is so
        helpful and mindset is so powerful.

      <h3>Blending these concepts with my learning plan</h3>
      <p>
        I think it is important to have a growth mindset and understanding of
        neuroplasticity and what helps enable more nueroplasticity as it
        reinforces how important it is to take breaks from the work when blocked
        - go for a walk, go exercise, meditation etc. And helps when stuck and
        feeling frustrated to not take it out on myself as it’s all about
        learning and making and solidifying those pathways and

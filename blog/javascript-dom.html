      <h2>JavaScript and the DOM</h2>
      <h3>What the heck is the DOM?</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM (or Document Object Model) can be described as a hierarchical
        structure that the browser uses to make sense of everything going on in
        the webpage. The <span class="emphasise-underline">Document</span> is
        the top most <span class="emphasise-underline">Object</span> in the DOM.
        The <span class="emphasise-underline">Model</span> is just a way of
        saying its lots of things all relating to one another in a tree-like
        structure.
      </p>
      <div class="examples">
        <img
          class="example"
          src="../images/DOM-example.png"
          alt="Example of the hierarchical structure of the DOM"
        />
        <figcaption>
          An example of the hierarchical (tree-like) structure of the DOM
        </figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>
        Each element in the DOM is called a
        <span class="emphasise-underline">node</span>, and other languages like
        CSS and Javascript are used to change what we see on a webpage by
        accessing the nodes via the DOM.
      </p>
      <p class="emphasise-italic">
        Woah, woah, woah! CSS, HTML, Javascript, I'm confused...
      </p>
      <h3>The difference between CSS and HTML (and JavaScript)</h3>
      <p>
        The three main <span class="emphasise-italic">languages</span> used in
        webpage design are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In basic terms, HTML is the
        structure of the page, CSS is how the page looks and JavaScript is how
        we interact with the page. This might make more sense if we think of
        them as animals. HTML is the hard working beaver who builds their dam
        super dooper technically sound and whilst pretty ugly (i mean it's just
        wood and junk) it does the job of being a damn good dam. CSS is like a
        unicorn. Everywhere it goes it adds glitter and sparkles and rainbows!
        This dam is ugly no more! JavaScript is a bit trickier to describe as an
        animal, but more like the little fairy that comes in and waves her
        little wand to create a door to get into the dam, or some fairy-lights,
        or a light up dance floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, now we know enough about how HTML, CSS and JavaScript all work
        together through the DOM, it's time to learn some more about JavaScript
        and a few of the ins and outs of this marvellous language.
      </p>
      <h3>Control Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow in JS (What we'll be referring to JavaScript as from now on
        because I'm a bit lazy) is exactly what is sounds like: the flow of the
        document. JS <span class="emphasise-italic">usually</span> flows from
        top of the page to bottom of the page. It starts executing code at the
        top and finishes once it gets to the bottom. If you'll allow me to
        introduce another analogy: driving to the gym. Control flow of driving
        to the gym <span class="emphasise-italic">usually</span> executes in the
        same order. We get into the car, buckle up, plug phone in to play some
        pump up jams, push the start button, check the mirrors, drive off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have said <span class="emphasise-italic">usually</span> above since
        sometimes things can run
        <span class="emphasise-italic">against the flow</span>. One of these
        instances is when we have
        <span class="emphasise-underline">Loops</span> in our code.
      </p>
      <h3>Loops! and Loops! and Loops! and Loops!</h3>
      <p>
        Say you're on your way to the gym and "Dang it! I forgot my shoes!""
        Better head back home and grab them. And then "Oh no! I forgot my towel"
        turning back around... Oh wow, we just experienced a loop! While this
        example of a loop is pretty annoying, loops in JS are pretty much the
        same! But they're not annoying - they're actually pretty useful! Loops
        are statements in the code that keep running on loop until there's
        nothing left to loop over.
      </p>
      <code>
        let gymGear = ['bag', 'shoes', 'skipping rope']<br />
        <br />
        for (i = 0; i > gymGear.length; i++) { <br />
        console.log(gymGear[i]) <br />
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        The above example shows a
        <span class="emphasise-underline">for loop</span> that iterates (or
        moves through, one by one) through an array of things I take to the gym.
        The flow of the code is temporarily interrupted and the loop is executed
        the amount of times as there are items in the array, then regular flow
        is resumed. This is just one example of loops. If you're interested in
        reading more about loops

      <h3>Accessing data from Arrays vs. Objects</h3>
      <p>
        I briefly introduced <span class="emphasise-underline">Arrays</span> in
        the previous section. An array is identified by square brackets [ ] and
        is a list of information, be it strings (words), numbers, or even
        objects or other arrays as well! Arrays store information in a list that
        have specific positions. (More on this soon.)
        <span class="emphasise-underline">Objects</span> are like arrays in that
        they store data, however they are much more complex. They are used when
        we want to represent a "thing" in our code. For example say I wanted to
        represent me in my code:
      </p>
      <code>
        let gymGear = ['bag', 'shoes', 'skipping rope']<br />
        // This is the gymGear array from before <br />
        <br />
        let person = { <br />
        name: 'cat', <br />
        age: 26, <br />
        shoes: 'black', <br />
        skippingRope: 'yellow' <br />
        }<br />
        //This object called person contains information about me and my gym
        gear too!
      </code>
      <p>
        As you can see, arrays and objects are similar in that they both hold
        information, but they are different in they uses and the information
        that they can hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key things about JS is using code to get information from
        data stored in arrays and objects. How fun! Unfortunately you can't just
        use the same method to get data from both of these variables. We have to
        use fun things called
        <span class="emphasise-italic">dot-notation</span> and
        <span class="emphasise-italic">bracket-notation</span>. With Objects we
        can use either dot- or bracket-notation to access information in our
        objects. But, with arrays, we can only use bracket-notation. Here's a
        code example to help visualise this!
      </p>
      <code>
        //bracket-notation for array <br />
        console.log(gymGear[0]) //logs the first (arrays begin at 0) item in our
        array, bag <br />
        <br />
        //dot-notation for object <br />
        person.name //prints 'cat' <br />
        <br />
        //bracket-notation for object <br />
        person['name'] //prints 'cat' - note the identifier has to also be a
        'string' <br />
      </code>
      <p>
        All of these look pretty similar and they two object ones do the same
        thing. So why do we need two different types of notation to access
        objects? One reason to use bracket-notation is that our identifiers can
        contain spaces and begin with a number and it won't throw an error,
        where it would if you tried to use dot notation.
      </p>
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        The last thing we're going to talk about today is
        <span class="emphasise-underline">Functions</span>. A function in JS is
        a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task. They are
        particularly helpful when we have bits of code that we want to use more
        than once. Say we want to print "Hello Cat!"
      </p>
      <code>
        function hello() { <br />
        print("Hello " + person.name + "!") <br />
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        Here I have written a function called 'hello' that will print "Hello "
        and the person.name that it took from the object declared earlier, plus
        "!" at the end. This can be very helpful if the name of the person
        changed say every time a new person logged into the website. A handy tip
        for functions is if you are copying code you've already written then you
        should turn it into a function!
      </p>
      <p>
        That's all for JavaScript and the Dom today, I hope you had a fun
        learning experience!

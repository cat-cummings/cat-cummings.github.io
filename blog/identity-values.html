            <h2>My Identity and Values</h2>
            <h3>Core Personal Values</h3>
            <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
            <p>A recent decision I had to make was whether or not my wife and I would travel to attend our niece's first birthday happening over Waitangi weekend in Timaru. Given the rise of Omicron cases and the fact that a significant amount of transmission and locations of interest are airports and planes we decided the risk was too high. Initially my mum and sister were upset, and didn't empathise with or understand our decision, a lot due to the fact they've chosen to not be vaccinated and believe some pretty unsubstantiated claims about COVID and the vaccine. Eventually, through assuring them that the decision wasn't made lightly, wasn't one we wanted to make and made the most sense for everyone's safety and well-being, they have softened their opinion of our decision even if they truly don't empathise with it.</p>
            <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
            <p>I was raised in a solo parent home with just my sister and mum. Seeing my mum struggle and have to work really hard for everything we had instilled a deep rooted value of hard work in myself. I am from a very large family with a lot of uncles, aunts and cousins and we are all quite close. This created a relationship heavy life and one of my core values is relationships. I value the relationships I have with people and always strive to be the best version of myself for others and try to be my most authentic self which is a trait I appreciate in others as well.</p>
            <h3>My Strengths and Limitations</h3>
            <h4>Evaluation of my strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career development</h4>
            <p>A lot of my strengths are learning based such as coach, strategist, philomath and altruistic. At first I didn't agree with these but on reflection I think that I haven't had a lot of opportunity in my working life so far to show these strengths and providing opportunities for others is really part of my core values so it makes sense. I look forward to the ability to use these skills as my learning and career develop. Some of my limitations include: being sensitive to criticism, being a perfectionist and reluctant to open up. I see a pattern here with these identified limitations, and I do agree with them. I very much in the past have tried to do things myself, without asking for help adn being upset if the outcome isn't prefect. These are traits that that will be a challenge to overcome but I like challenges and I look forward to embracing imperfection, asking for help and taking criticism, or help, in a positive growth mindset.</p>
            <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>
            <p>I think my strengths of openness, diligence and the aforementioned learning based strengths will help my learning journey because I truly do enjoy learning and in particular I enjoy learning new things constantly and the world of web development is so fluid that I think it fits my personality and strengths super well. They might intersect with learning obstacles when others in my team may be having a harder time understanding something and I can be quite impatient sometimes, especially when tired, so I will need to be cognisant of that and keep a coaching and patient mindset. Similarly when I don't understand a topic and others do, I will need to be patient with myself.</p>
            <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
            <p>At my previous job I was part of a team that had to work very collaboratively to complete the daily tasks. Often, particular co-workers would protest the task they were being asked to do and would complain or flat out refuse. At the time the strategies I used were diplomacy in trying to find tasks that everyone was happy doing, trying to find the least tension possible. At the time it was sometimes successful and sometimes not, as it wasn't always possible to find a solution for everyone and some people were left unhappy. Now I think I would try more of a collaborative system where staff get to choose their priority list of tasks and the roster is made in a way that is more fair and everyone wins more evenly.</p>

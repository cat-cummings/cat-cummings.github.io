            <h2>My EDA Learning Plan</h2>
            <h4>Long term goal and career pathway</h4>
            <p>My main drive for doing EDA is to get a job in the tech industry, both here and in Denver where I will be moving in the next couple of years (wife’s whanau are there). At this stage I think I will be wanting a career in back-end processes like data management, but obviously it’s a bit early in the course to say what I enjoy most in web-dev. My dream job is to do sports stats for a sports team (I love sports and stats lol) or something where I am helping the environment/society in a positive way (not working for Amazon or big corps. basically).</p>
            <h4>Strenghts and limitations in relation ot my learning</h4>
            <p>I am  a fast learner and hard-working. When I set my mind toward something I go for it 100%. I don’t mind grinding away at something for hours to get it done, however this can mean I spend too long making something perfect and put time pressure on myself to get it finished. This will mean I will have to stick to time-boxing outlines and be okay with some stuff not being 100% perfect as I’d like it to be.</p>
            <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
            <p>I would like to develop my ability to reflect others feelings, especially when I am drained or feeling defensive. This is one of my weaknesses (and many Kiwis too, I believe) in that I have a tendency to jump to conclusions that something is my fault or my doing and it makes it difficult to listen and understand from someone else’s point of view.</p>
            <h4>My commitment to how I will manage workload in this programme</h4>
            <p>Sometimes I can be really bull-headed and stubborn in thinking that my way of doing things is the best. I will make a commitment to be diplomatic in group/pair scenarios and work collaboratively to get work done. I think there is a lot of opportunity in this course to learn from others, while also acknowledging that everyone learns and does things differently - there is no “right” or “wrong” way, as long as the code works (and looking good doesn’t hurt either).</p>
            <p>I am big into making lists. When I’m feeling overwhelmed I like to make a list of things I need to accomplish and start with the easier stuff to get the juices flowing then work on the bigger tasks. Being honest with myself and my facilitator when I’m struggling will be a big help and again, not striving for perfection (which is impossible) but striving to do my best day-by-day</p>
            <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
            <p>I expect honesty and transparency. As a person with anxiety I have a tendency to overthink things and look into stuff a bit much so I will make a commitment to take what facilitators say at face value and I expect honesty and transparency in return. Like if my work sucks tell me, if it’s awesome tell me, don’t sugar coat things</p>
            <h4>Any other commitments? How will this work?</h4>
            <p>Going to the gym is super important for me and my mental health. During boot camp I plan on going in the mornings so there shouldn’t be any conflicts there</p>

      <h2>My EDA Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>Foundations Plan</h3>
      <h4>Long term goal and career pathway</h4>
      <p>
        My main drive for doing EDA is to get a job in the tech industry, both
        here and in Denver where I will be moving in the next couple of years
        (wife’s whanau are there). At this stage I think I will be wanting a
        career in back-end processes like data management, but obviously it’s a
        bit early in the course to say what I enjoy most in web-dev. My dream
        job is to do sports stats for a sports team (I love sports and stats
        lol) or something where I am helping the environment/society in a
        positive way (not working for Amazon or big corps. basically).
      </p>
      <h4>Strenghts and limitations in relation ot my learning</h4>
      <p>
        I am a fast learner and hard-working. When I set my mind toward
        something I go for it 100%. I don’t mind grinding away at something for
        hours to get it done, however this can mean I spend too long making
        something perfect and put time pressure on myself to get it finished.
        This will mean I will have to stick to time-boxing outlines and be okay
        with some stuff not being 100% perfect as I’d like it to be.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at EDA?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my ability to reflect others feelings,
        especially when I am drained or feeling defensive. This is one of my
        weaknesses (and many Kiwis too, I believe) in that I have a tendency to
        jump to conclusions that something is my fault or my doing and it makes
        it difficult to listen and understand from someone else’s point of view.
      </p>
      <h4>My commitment to how I will manage workload in this programme</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes I can be really bull-headed and stubborn in thinking that my
        way of doing things is the best. I will make a commitment to be
        diplomatic in group/pair scenarios and work collaboratively to get work
        done. I think there is a lot of opportunity in this course to learn from
        others, while also acknowledging that everyone learns and does things
        differently - there is no “right” or “wrong” way, as long as the code
        works (and looking good doesn’t hurt either).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am big into making lists. When I’m feeling overwhelmed I like to make
        a list of things I need to accomplish and start with the easier stuff to
        get the juices flowing then work on the bigger tasks. Being honest with
        myself and my facilitator when I’m struggling will be a big help and
        again, not striving for perfection (which is impossible) but striving to
        do my best day-by-day
      </p>
      <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        I expect honesty and transparency. As a person with anxiety I have a
        tendency to overthink things and look into stuff a bit much so I will
        make a commitment to take what facilitators say at face value and I
        expect honesty and transparency in return. Like if my work sucks tell
        me, if it’s awesome tell me, don’t sugar coat things
      </p>
      <h4>Any other commitments? How will this work?</h4>
      <p>
        Going to the gym is super important for me and my mental health. During
        boot camp I plan on going in the mornings so there shouldn’t be any
        conflicts there
      </p>
      <h3>Bootcamp Plan</h3>
      <h4>Long term goal and career pathway</h4>
      <p>
        I’m really just excited for anything in the tech industry. I have a big
        love for sustainability, so working somewhere that helps people and/or
        the planet would be really cool. I also love sports, so sports stats
        area is really interesting for me. I’m mostly just excited to see where
        my path leads and take it as it comes.
      </p>
      <h4>Strengths and limitations Bootcamp</h4>
      <p>
        As discovered in foundations values exercise I think my limitations will
        be asking for help, taking constructive criticism as a positive and
        being comfortable not knowing or not being the best. I think my
        strengths of openness and diligence will help me overcome these
        limitations and have a positive and growth focussed mindset.
      </p>
      <h4>Biggest perceived non-technical challenge in Bootcamp</h4>
      <p>
        I think my biggest challenge will be being comfortable sitting in not
        knowing the answers all the time and taking everything as a learning
        journey and really focussing in on the not yet and growth mindset.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at EDA?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Again, I would like to develop my listening and looping skills to better
        communicate with and understand others. Especially when an issue
        involves me, and being able to remove my feelings from the situation to
        reflect the other persons experience.
      </p>
      <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
      <p>
        I expect continued transparency with feedback and feedforward. Truthful
        conversations are really important for me and I expect the Bootcamp team
        are super experienced dealing with students of all kinds and they’ll do
        a fantastic job helping each of us to succeed - as long as we ask for
        help when needed.
      </p>
      <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>
      <p>
        To not be good at everything and to be okay with that. I hope I can keep
        myself accountable for the work and if I’m struggling I need to ask for
        help early rather than wasting time trying to figure it out myself,
        since Bootcamp moves a lot faster. I also want to remain being my
        authentic self and keep my joy and openness and all my good
        people/relationship based values even when I may be stressed out.

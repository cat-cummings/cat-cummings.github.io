      <h3>Real-life Examples of my Problem Solving</h3>
      <h4>Example 1: Getting blocked on a simple problem</h4>
      <p>
        Something simple that I got blocked on (and honestly I get blocked on
        stuff as simple as this embarrassingly often) is forgetting to put the
        brackets at the end of a function. While working on the built-in methods
        JavaScript Kata I was working on the function that capitalizes the first
        letter of each word in a sentence I had what I thought should have been
        a working function that passed the test. But, alas, no go. I worked
        through my pseudo-code line-by-line to check that I had done everything
        needed. Then I went back and commented out the last lines I had done,
        yep those parts of the function work. Next, I checked the documentation
        on W3 and MDN. It looked like I had everything right, but then flicking
        between the documentation and my code I realised I’d missed the crucial
        () at the end of the method. Once added, viola, it passes. I felt a bit
        silly like I was stuck on something so simple, what a waste of time. But
        every time you do something wrong you learn a little bit more on. How to
        not do it again. I learned that when checking through the code to ask
        myself “does it need anything else?”. Also, to read error messages
        carefully (more so for other times I’ve done this, since the test error
        message didn’t supply this crucial information for me).
      </p>
      <h4>Example 2: Solving a problem in an elegant way</h4>
      <p>
        A time I solved a problem in an elegant way, was in the grade book KATA
        we’d been tasked with completing. I had been struggling to get my head
        around using the arrow function syntax as opposed to the old school way
        of writing functions. But given we’d just been prompted to try using
        arrow syntax for single line functions, I thought a couple of the
        functions could be written the ES6 way. Instead of writing the function
        like normal and refactoring to the arrow function, I challenged myself
        to write it that way first time. I first looked at the EDA example of
        arrow functions and wrote out on a sticky-note on my desk the basic
        structure of how they work so I could understand it more thoroughly.
        Then I psuedocoded what I wanted my code to do, and finally I jumped
        into it and wrote out how I thought the function should go. I had to
        look at some more documentation (especially for accessing the object
        properties with dot vs bracket notation) and eventually I got it
        working! I felt super accomplished and stoked that I could do it without
        first writing then refactoring.

      <h3>Some Problem Solving techniques</h3>
      <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a huge list person. Love writing down a list of things I need to do
        and crossing each item off one by one. Even more exciting is writing a
        list for a list! That's basically what pseudocoding is. Writing out in
        plain english, via commenting your code, step-by-step of what you want
        your code to do or achieve. Personally, I really enjoy this method and
        find it super helpful to see what it is you're tying to achieve and
        where you're at right now.
        <code
          >//this is a comment <br />
          //step 1 <br />
          //step 2 <br />
          //and so on <br
        /></code>
      </p>
      <h4>Trying Something</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes I can find it difficult to wrap my head around just trying
        something and using that failure to figure out what to do next. Even
        though it can be scary, I'm getting used to it and using that feedback
        to keep moving toward the correct answer to a problem. Someone super
        smart once said "Sometimes you just have to throw some pasta at a wall
        and see what sticks."
      </p>
      <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
      <p>
        The Rubber Ducky Method is surprisingly less about the rubber ducky and
        more about hearing yourself explain something out loud to make more
        sense of it for yourself. It is described as explaining, verbally or
        written, in simple terms what you're trying to get your code to do. Then
        going through more detail of the steps you need to do. Much like
        psuedocoding but better for people that are verbal rather than visual
        learners. I find it helpful explaining to my partner when I can't get
        something to work (especially since she has zero idea of coding at all).
        So I can see how this method can be helpful when there aren't any human
        ears around to listen in.
      </p>
      <h4>Error Messages</h4>
      <p>
        While the error messages that come up in coding can look very
        intimidating, they actually dish out some very helpful information. For
        example, the error message below shows that it wasn't expecting the
        token 'if' to be there. That alludes to there is probably a missing
        character of '{' before the if statement. The error message also tells
        us where the error is occurring, in this case on line 7.
      </p>

        src="../images/error-example.png"
        class="example"
        alt="an example error message showing a Syntax Error: unexpected token"
      />
      <h4>Console.log()</h4>
      <p>
        A very helpful method that JS has built in is console.log(). This method
        allows you to 'log' (basically print out) to the console whatever you
        have identified between the parentheses. This can be helpful to see if
        what you're trying to achieve at this stage of he code is executing
        correctly. I find this to be a very handy developer tool and helps to
        see things visually since a lot of the time when you execute code
        nothing really appears to be happening.
      </p>
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>
        Ah, our good friend Google! As previously stated, I use Google a lot.
        Almost any problem you've encountered, someone else has as well. And
        while there are a million ways to write a piece of code, reading
        documentation (my favourites are Mozilla Development and W3), or
        question forums like stackflow and reddit are great places to help get
        unblocked.
      </p>
      <h4>Asking Peers/Coaches for help</h4>
      <p>
        Just like if you have an issue someone online has probably had the same
        one, your peers and coaches have probably had that issue as well. Asking
        for help, personally, is pretty scary, but it can be really helpful to
        get a point in the right direction. And even though I don't like asking
        for help, there are usually other people that have had the same or
        similar issues so you're not just helping yourself but the eco-system of
        budding coders as a whole.
      </p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        A big part of getting better is reflection. Research shows that just 5
        mins of reflection at the end of the day can help to solidify learning.
        And problem solving is learning. Reflecting on what sorts of problem
        solving did and didn't work for you will help you hone in your problem
        solving skills and be able to work through issues a bit quicker each
        time.
